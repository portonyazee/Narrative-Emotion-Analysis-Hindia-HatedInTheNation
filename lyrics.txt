[Verse 1]
We don't talk about this back home
Lock me up if I talk about this back home
Mistreated some of us back home
Colonized what's left in the West back home
We sure play pretend back home
Picking scraps of what we used to call home
Cautious of how I use my phone
Fearful of how I set my tone

[Pre-Chorus]
Can only sing these songs in English
I know my chances, yeah, so I'll take the piss
I don't have much time, let me finish
A little space for things to say
That got me

[Chorus]
Oh, hated in the nation
I know I'll be
Oh, hated in the nation
The nation

[Verse 2]
We can't talk about this back home
Tiptoe when you talk about home
I know you get demonized back home
Full speed demolition back home

[Pre-Chorus]
Can only sing these songs in English
Unless I wanna sleep with the fishes
Saudara sedarah menangis
A little space for things to say
That got me

[Chorus]
Oh, hated in the nation
I know I'll be
Oh, hated in the nation
The nation
Oh, hated in the nation
I know I'll be
Oh, hated in the nation
The nation
